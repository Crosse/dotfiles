# pkgsrc on OSX adds /etc/paths.d/10-pkgsrc, which somehow magically
# tells OSX's man(1) that it should look in /opt/pkg/share/man for man
# pages (I think). It also automatically prepends /opt/pkg/{s,}bin/ to
# the PATH for you, so there's no need to manipulate it here.

# We can't use prepend_to_path here; if MANPATH is empty (as it is on
# CentOS and Debian, at least), then after prepend_to_path() the
# variable would consist of only /usr/pkg/man, which would override
# anything that /etc/man_db.conf would have come up with. Instead, if
# you prepend or append a colon to the variable, then whatever is in the
# variable will be appended or prepended to the list instead of simply
# overwriting it. Whew.
