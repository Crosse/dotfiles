# 2022-09-07: these lines aren't needed, but they're here to document
# the travesty I've committed. I have two Yubikeys, one for personal
# and one for work. I'd like to keep them separate. I also don't want
# to interfere with ssh on machines where these files--and the
# yubikeys--don't exist. To that end, I think the best way to handle
# this is to appropriate the always-searched paths of the `id_ecdsa`
# and `id_ecdsa-sk` keys (mostly because the yubikeys have ECDSA
# keys). I can symlink the real key files, named something like
# `id_yubikey-{geode,prism}.pub (for the sake of having more
# documentation as to which is which), to `id_ecdsa{,_sk}.pub` (and
# the cert files similarly). SSH will always load them when it goes
# looking for keys or certs (...assuming the yubikeys themselves are
# connected and loaded into ssh-agent, I guess), but the nonexistence
# of the files on any other machine won't throw errors or warnings.
